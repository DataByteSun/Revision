## Basic Statistics
### Descriptive Statistics:
Understand measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. Practice calculating these statistics for given datasets.
#### Mean: 
- **Definition:** The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values.
- **Formula:** Mean (μ) = Σx / n, where Σx represents the sum of all values and n is the total number of values.
- **Significance:** The mean provides a measure of central tendency, indicating the typical value in the dataset.
#### Median:
- **Definition:** The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If it has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
-	**Significance:** Unlike the mean, the median is not affected by outliers, making it a robust measure of central tendency, especially for skewed distributions.
#### Mode:
-	**Definition:** The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
-	**Significance:** The mode helps identify the most common value or category in the dataset. It is particularly useful for categorical data or when identifying peaks in a distribution.
#### Variance:
-	**Definition:** Variance measures the spread or dispersion of the values in a dataset. It quantifies how much the values deviate from the mean.
-	**Formula:** Variance (σ²) = Σ((x - μ)²) / n, where (x - μ) represents the deviation of each value from the mean, squared.
-	**Significance:** A higher variance indicates greater dispersion of data points from the mean, while a lower variance suggests that data points are closer to the mean.
#### Standard Deviation:
-	**Definition:** Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average distance of each data point from the mean.
-	**Formula:** Standard Deviation (σ) = √(Σ((x - μ)²) / n)
-	**Significance:** Standard deviation is widely used to assess the variability or volatility of data. It is sensitive to outliers and provides a more interpretable measure of spread compared to variance.
